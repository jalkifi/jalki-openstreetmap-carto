# CartoCSS stylesheets for JÃ¤lki.fi 



![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/master/preview.png)

This a forked version of openstreetmap-carto, the CartoCSS map stylesheet for OpenStreetMap. It has mostly the same appearance as the default OSM style, but with a few tweaks.

These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed
to be easily customised. They work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
 and also with the command-line [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) processor.


# Installation

You need a PostGIS database populated with OpenStreetMap data along with auxillary shapefiles.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
